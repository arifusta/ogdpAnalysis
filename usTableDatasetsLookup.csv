Preterm births are all live births less than 37 weeks of gestation. Very preterm births are all live births less than 32 weeks of gestation. Important growth and development occur throughout pregnancy, especially in the final months and weeks. There is a higher risk of serious disability or death the earlier a baby is born. Gestational age is based on obstetric estimate at delivery (OE). Data includes births with gestational age of 17-47 weeks.  Note: The race and ethnic groups in this table utilize eight mutually exclusive race and ethnicity categories. These categories are Hispanic and the following Non-Hispanic categories of Multi-Race, African-American, American Indian (includes Eskimo and Aleut), Asian, Pacific Islander (includes Hawaiian), White (includes Other race) and Unknown (includes refused to state and missing).                                                                                                 

Data should not be compared to other data where gestational age is based on the date of last normal menses (LMP) and not OE. The National Center for Health Statistics recently transitioned to using an OE-based gestational age measure due to increasing evidence  of its greater validity compared with the LMP-based measure.

The SCLRG is a partnership between scientists, managers, stakeholders, and volunteers, and encompasses personnel from the San Diego State University (SDSU), Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), the San Diego Oceans Foundation (SDOF), the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), and the California Lobster Trap Fishermen’s Association (CLTFA). We identified five sites in the South Coast Region at which to work, each with a newly established MPA: (1) the Cabrillo SMR in San Diego, (2) the South La Jolla SMR in La Jolla, (3) Swami’s SMCA in Encinitas, (4) the Laguna Beach SMR in Laguna Beach, and (5) the Pt. Vicente SMCA in Palos Verdes. Inside and outside of MPAs at each site, we conducted daytime SCUBA-based transect surveys of rocky reefs (5 – 15 m depth) between May and September of 2012 and 2013. The number of lobsters in four different size categories, as well depth, relief, and benthic habitat features (biogenic and non-biogenic) were recorded on each transect."

ACE addresses both terrestrial and aquatic data. The ACE model combines and analyzes terrestrial information in a 2.5 square mile hexagon grid and aquatic information at the HUC12 watershed level across the state to produce a series of maps for use in non-regulatory evaluation of conservation priorities in California. The model addresses as many of CDFWs statewide conservation and recreational mandates as feasible using high quality data sources. High value areas statewide and in each USDA Ecoregion were identified. The ACE maps and data can be viewed in the ACE online map viewer, or downloaded for use in ArcGIS.

California has a new blueprint for reducing COVID-19 in the state with revised criteria for loosening and tightening restrictions on activities. Every county in California is assigned to a tier based on its test positivity and adjusted case rate for tier assignment. Additionally, a new health equity metric took effect on October 6, 2020. In order to advance to the next less restrictive tier, each county will need to meet an equity metric or demonstrate targeted investments to eliminate disparities in levels of COVID-19 transmission, depending on its size. The California Health Equity Metric is designed to help guide counties in their continuing efforts to reduce COVID-19 cases in all communities and requires more intensive efforts to prevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 among Californians who have been disproportionately impacted by this pandemic.

Note: 
This table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. 

Footnotes:
U: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.
-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.
N: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.
NN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.
NP: Nationally notifiable but not published.
NC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.
Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.
Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.
* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions.

Eligible hospitals are in the 50 states and the District of Columbia and include noninstitutional and nonfederal hospitals with six or more staffed inpatient beds.  Settings currently include inpatient and emergency departments (ED). The survey collects electronic data (Uniform Bill (UB–04) administrative claims or electronic health records) for all encounters in a calendar year from a nationally representative sample of 608 hospitals. NHCS contributes data that may inform public health emergencies as the survey is designed to capture emerging diseases and viruses that require hospitalizations, including COVID-19 encounters. The 2020 NHCS is not yet fully operational so it is important to note that these data are not nationally representative.

The NHCS results provided on COVID-19 hospital use are from UB–04 administrative claims data from March 18, 2020 through October 27, 2020 from 56 hospitals that submitted inpatient data and 55 hospitals that submitted ED data. The data used in these figures are considered preliminary, and the results may change with subsequent releases. Even though the data are not nationally representative, they can provide insight on the impact of COVID-19 on various types of hospitals throughout the country. The NHCS data from these hospitals can show results by a combination of indicators related to COVID-19, such as length of inpatient stay, in-hospital mortality, comorbidities, and intubation or ventilator use. Additionally, NHCS data allow for reporting on patient conditions and treatments within the hospital over time."

Energy flows through nature into social systems as life support. Human societies depended on renewable, solar powered energy for fuel, shelter, tools, and other items for most of our history. Today, when we flip on a light switch, turn an ignition or a water faucet, or eat a hamburger, we engage complex energy extraction systems that largely rely on non-renewable energy to power our lives. About 90% of Vermont's total energy consumption is currently generated from non-renewable energy sources. This dependency puts Vermont at considerable risk, as the peaking of world oil production, global financial instability, climate change, and other factors impact the state."

We followed the least-cost corridor techniques described by Beier et al. (2007). This analysis identified the least-cost corridor, or the best potential route for each species, between neighboring landscape blocks. The data needed for a least-cost corridor analysis are a resistance raster and landscape blocks. The resistance raster is the inverse of the species distribution model (SDM) output (i.e., Maxent or BioView habitat models, which rank habitat suitability across the landscape from 0-100 for each species). We identified habitat patches for each focal species within each landscape block, and connected those habitat patches using the least-cost corridor models. The least-cost corridor model does not identify barriers, risk and dispersal. We removed urban areas and areas of unsuitable/non-restorable habitat from the corridors and then inspected the corridor to make sure they were continuous. We examined the amount of predicted suitable habitat in each corridor, and measured the distance between habitat patches within each corridor to make sure it was within the maximum dispersal distance for that focal species. If the corridors did not meet these rules then habitat patches on the border of the corridor were added to meet the selection requirements.

The exceptionally high diversity of marine life in this region is largely due to the mixing of several major oceanographic current systems, and the region is characterized by strong gradients in environmental conditions. Rocky shores characterize approximately 26.83% of the SCSR, and in many areas attract a large number of individuals who frequent the intertidal zone for recreation, education, and for collecting flora and fauna for food, fish bait, or decoration. Rocky intertidal ecosystems are one of the most heavily human-­‐impacted ecosystems along the mainland southern California coast (in addition to sandy beaches) due to their ease of access, and has made them particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of human activities resulting from both extraction (harvesting and collecting) as well as physicaldisturbance (trampling, overturning and handling)."

California has a new blueprint for reducing COVID-19 in the state with revised criteria for loosening and tightening restrictions on activities. Every county in California is assigned to a tier based on its test positivity and adjusted case rate for tier assignment. Additionally, a new health equity metric took effect on October 6, 2020. In order to advance to the next less restrictive tier, each county will need to meet an equity metric or demonstrate targeted investments to eliminate disparities in levels of COVID-19 transmission, depending on its size. The California Health Equity Metric is designed to help guide counties in their continuing efforts to reduce COVID-19 cases in all communities and requires more intensive efforts to prevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 among Californians who have been disproportionately impacted by this pandemic.

Please see https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyMonitoringOverview.aspx for more information.

These data are provided in a single data file in netCDF format, and can be used for analysis for ocean, ice, and hydrology phenomena. This version of the data employs a Coastal Resolution Improvement (CRI) filter that reduces signal leakage errors across coastlines. The water storage/height anomalies are given in equivalent water thickness units (cm). The solution provided here is derived from solving for monthly gravity field variations in terms of geolocated spherical cap mass concentration functions, rather than global spherical harmonic coefficients. Additionally, realistic geophysical information is introduced during the solution inversion to intrinsically remove correlated error. Thus, these Mascon grids do not need to be destriped or smoothed, like traditional spherical harmonic gravity solutions. The complete Mascon solution consists of 4,551 relatively independent estimates of surface mass change that have been derived using an equal-area 3-degree grid of individual mascons. A subset of these individual mascons span coastlines, and contain mixed land and ocean mass change signals.  In a post-processing step, the CRI filter is applied to those mixed land/ocean Mascons to separate land and ocean mass. The land mask used to perform this separation is provided in the same directory as this dataset. Since the individual mascons act as an inherent smoother on the gravity field, a set of optional gain factors (for continental hydrology applications) that can be applied to the solution to study mass change signals at sub-mascon resolution is also provided within the same data directory as the Mascon data. Please refer to the 'Data Access' tab at the top of this page to gain direct access to the Mascon data. For more information, please visit https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/get-data/jpl_global_mascons/.

The fully vaccinated are a subset of the number who have received at least one dose. The number with At Least One Dose and the number Fully Vaccinated add up to more than the total number of doses because people who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine fit into both categories.

The linkages incorporate data and information for 30 focal species, including 9 passage species (species that move through the corridor) and 21 corridor dwellers (species that may take more than one generation to move through a corridor). The linkages are made up of a least-cost corridor union and additional habitat patch information for corridor dwellers. The least-cost union is a union of the least-cost corridor analysis, based on species specific habitat models, for nine focal passage species (total number of corridors identified for each species follows the species name): black bear (47), black-tailed jackrabbit (105), bobcat (81), dusky-footed woodrat (98), gray fox (85), mountain lion (66), mule deer (134), western gray squirrel (99) and western pond turtle (84). Many species corridors were overlapping despite diverse habitat needs and the use of species specific data to build the habitat suitability models. Habitat areas for corridor dwellers, based on habitat suitability modeling and patch analysis, was added to the least-cost union: We identified all habitat patches within the corridor union, measured distance between each habitat patch to make sure it was within the maximum dispersal distance for that corridor dweller, and when needed added habitat near the corridor edge to meet the species dispersal needs. Redundant corridors were deleted to provide cleaner linkage areas. This analysis identified multiple swaths of habitat that species have the potential to reside in or move through. To ensure that ecological processes were protected in each linkage, we imposed a minimum width of 1 km for linkages.

Source: Completed Protected Bike Lane reports are received from ATD. ARR then tracks internally the number of sweeping cycles completed. 
Contains: The linear miles (measured in curb miles) of protected bikeways swept by street sweepers. Curb miles represent the length of streets along the curb. Since bikeways can be one-way (one side of the street) or two-way (both sides of the street), curb miles count full distances (a two-way bikeway will measure both sides of the street, i.e. both curbs). Curb miles that were swept are counted monthly, and can exceed the available curb miles when bikeways are swept more than once in the same month. Available curb miles are counted quarterly.  Usage: This data set can be used in determining budget and resource allocation.  In addition, it is used to track how many full sweep cycles are completed in a given fiscal year.

This analysis identified the least-cost corridor, or the best potential route for each species, between neighboring landscape blocks. The data needed for a least-cost corridor analysis are a resistance raster and landscape blocks. The resistance raster is the inverse of the species distribution model (SDM) output (i.e., Maxent or BioView habitat models, which rank habitat suitability across the landscape from 0-100 for each species). We identified habitat patches for each focal species within each landscape block, and connected those habitat patches using the least-cost corridor models. The least-cost corridor model does not identify barriers, risk and dispersal. We removed urban areas and areas of unsuitable/non-restorable habitat from the corridors and then inspected the corridor to make sure they were continuous. We examined the amount of predicted suitable habitat in each corridor, and measured the distance between habitat patches within each corridor to make sure it was within the maximum dispersal distance for that focal species.

To accomplish this goal our research team conducted extensive community outreach and engagement in the region and conducted in-person interviewed CPFV operators to gather post MPA baseline socioeconomic data and spatial fishing data for the year 2013. Additional to the interview data gathered, we summarized CPFV logbook data from 1992 to 2014 obtained from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to explore historical economic trends and initial changes in North Coast fisheries. This data package include the CPFV logbook data from 1992-20142 provided by California Department of Fish and Wildlife summarized to the port and region level; select summarized survey data from CPFV operator interviews about their operations in the 2013 calendar year, and samples of the spatial data available on the post MPA (2013) fishing grounds at region-fishery and port-fishery scales."

The sampling design, selected response variables (i.e. key species) and analytical approaches are intended to provide scientists, managers, stakeholders and policymakers with a baseline for future assessment of the effectiveness of the SCSR MPAs. Further, the outcomes from this study will also provide recommendations for long-term monitoring metrics and cost-effective survey protocols for the SCSR. Specific objectives are:

1. Provide a quantitative baseline characterization of the rocky reef and kelp forest ecosystem feature inside and outside of MPAs in the SCSR.
2. Provide pre-MPA implementation data and historical context to ongoing data collection by analyzing RCCA’s existing dataset in the context of the new MPAs.
3. Explore the baseline characterizations for potential indicators of the state of the kelp forest ecosystem (i.e. ecosystem indicators) and make recommendations for long-term monitoring.
4. Build capacity for cost-effective, long-term MPA monitoring through the continued involvement of community members in the monitoring of MPAs.
5. Expand existing public online data dissemination and illustration tool (NED) to inform managers, stakeholders, policymakers and the public about the status of the marine environment in the SCSR."

<b>Description</b>
The MD COVID-19 - Total Confirmed Deaths Statewide data layer is a collection of the statewide confirmed COVID-19 related deaths that have been reported each day by the Vital Statistics Administration. A death is classified as confirmed if the person had a laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 test result. Some data on deaths may be unavailable due to the time lag between the death, typically reported by a hospital or other facility, and the submission of the complete death certificate. Probable deaths are available from the MD COVID-19 - Total Probable Deaths Statewide data layer. 
Update 5/27/21: The Maryland Department of Health (MDH) Vital Statistics Administration (VSA) revised the state’s COVID-19 data to include deaths that were not properly classified by medical certifiers over the past year. VSA identified these deaths as COVID-19 deaths through an information reconciliation process utilizing other sources of data.

Road /stream crossings are extremely numerous and often cross multiple road ownerships within a watershed. Passage impediments and delays in migration affect both adult and juvenile fish. Given the magnitude and severity of the problem, reconnecting isolated stream habitat has become an important priority for the restoration of impaired anadromous salmon and steelhead stocks. A comprehensive CDFW fish passage program is vital towards identifying, prioritizing, and treating migration barriers so that unimpeded migration of California''s salmonid populations is achieved. By coordinating resources with CDFW fisheries engineers, the Fisheries Restoration Grant Program and in conjunction with the Fish Passage Forum, a comprehensive program will aid in the recovery and de-listing of salmon and steelhead, in California. In 2008, the California departments of Fish and Game (now California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW)) and Transportation (Caltrans) met with staff from the Assembly committees on Natural Resources and Transportation to discuss joint agency collaboration on prioritizing and remediating fish barriers to salmon and steelhead migration. This was in response to Senate Bill 857 requiring the California Department of Transportation to complete an assessment of potential barriers to anadromous fish prior to commencing any project using State or Federal transportation funds. In addition to the expectation that both agencies would develop a mutual list of priority barriers occurring along transportation corridors, a request was made to CDFW to provide a statewide list of priority barriers based on significance to fish migration and independent of who manages or is responsible for the stream crossing. CDFW developed its first list in 2011 and the point features mapped in this dataset represent the barrier locations from this list. CDFW has a more comprehensive list of barriers to salmon and steelhead migration; these barriers represent our effort to demonstrate and emphasize barrier priorities across both Coastal and Central Valley watercourses. As such, this spatial dataset presents the top priorities in each twenty-four Coastal and Central Valley counties for fish passage improvement. This list is a result of compilation and review by CDFW Regional biologists and supervisors (Regions 1-5) and by the Fisheries Branch. The prioritization process considered the following criteria: 1) high likelihood to improve migration for anadromous species; 2) availability of recent data of fish and habitat; 3) willing partners and land access; 4) known political support at a local, State or national level; 5) the site is a barrier to a federal recovery plan ""Core"" population; 6) the watercourse is an eco-regional significant watershed; 7) CDFW is committed to monitoring before, during and after any barrier improvement project is undertaken; and 8) the site is considered to be a ""keystone barrier"", meaning the barrier was the lower-most in that river or creek. Visit http://www.calfish.org/tabid/420/Default.aspx to view the 2017 CDFW datasheet that the creation of this spatial dataset was based on. Compare the point locations found in this dataset to point locations with matching PAD_IDs in the California Fish Passage Assessment Database to get detailed information such as each barriers current barrier type, passage status, treatment status, and year removed (if applicable)."

This difference in the frequency of sampling is concerning given the many economically and ecologically important organisms, along with the unique and productive habitats in which they occur, that are found below 100 m. With the creation of the new network of marine protected areas, over 35% (330 km2) of the State’s shelf and slope deeper than 100 m are now protected within State Marine Reserves and

First, we used data from aerial photographic surveys conducted from 1989-2014 to investigate region-wide trends in the populations of Common Murres and Brandt’s Cormorants. We used 173 observations of Common Murre colony abundance at 14 colonies and 123 observations of Brandt’s Cormorant nest abundance at 10 colonies over the 26-year study period. Additionally, aerial photographic surveys conducted in 2014 were used to document location and abundance of Common Murre, Brandt’s Cormorant, and Double-crested Cormorant across the NCSR.

Second, at a more localized scale, we monitored Common Murre reproduction, foraging effort, and diet in 2014 at Castle Rock National Wildlife Refuge using a robotic, remotely-controlled video recording system. Although this is only one of the seabird colonies in the NCSR, it the largest and served to inform our understanding of the mechanisms of population change across the region. Common Murre are very visible and thus ideal for monitoring fine scale patterns in reproduction and changing diet. We measured date of nest initiation, hatching success, fledging success, overall reproductive success, time allocation, provisioning rate, and diet composition via the video. Information gained from these surveys were combined with comparable data from 2007-2013 at Castle Rock to assess baseline condition and variability of these metrics over an 8-year period.

Third, in 2014-2015 we conducted ground-based surveys of coastally breeding seabirds inside and outside of six MPAs to establish a framework for continued MPA monitoring. For this, we conducted intensive monitoring of six species likely to benefit from MPA establishment: Pigeon Guillemot, Brandt’s Cormorant, Pelagic Cormorant, Double-crested Cormorant, Western Gull, and Black Oystercatcher. We collected data on breeding population size, breeding productivity, foraging rates and rates of human-caused disturbance inside and outside of each MPA. We monitored productivity by following individual nests visible from land and calculated annual breeding productivity as number of fledglings produced per breeding pair. We monitored foraging from land-based observation points, recording all birds foraging within a 1 km radius of an observation point. We calculated foraging rates as number of birds foraging per hour of observation. We recorded all human-caused disturbances observed during any land-based survey and calculated disturbance rates as number of disturbances per hour of observation."

To accomplish this goal our research team conducted extensive community outreach and engagement in the region and conducted in-person interviewed CPFV operators to gather post MPA baseline socioeconomic data and spatial fishing data for the year 2013. Additional to the interview data gathered, we summarized CPFV logbook data from 1992 to 2014 obtained from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to explore historical economic trends and initial changes in North Coast fisheries. This data package include the CPFV logbook data from 1992-20142 provided by California Department of Fish and Wildlife summarized to the port and region level; select summarized survey data from CPFV operator interviews about their operations in the 2013 calendar year, and samples of the spatial data available on the post MPA (2013) fishing grounds at region-fishery and port-fishery scales."

This table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.

Beginning in 1998, the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, began a cooperative project aimed at collecting, archiving, and entering into standardized electronic formats, the wealth of information generated by fisheries resource management agencies and tribes throughout California.Extensive data are currently available for chinook, coho, and steelhead. Major data categories include adult abundance population estimates, actual fish and/or carcass counts, counts of fish collected at dams, weirs, or traps, and redd counts. Harvest data has been compiled for many streams, and hatchery return data has been compiled for the states mitigation facilities. A draft format has been developed for juvenile abundance and awaits final approval. This CalFish Abundance Database shapefile was generated from fully routed 1:100,000 hydrography. In a few cases streams had to be added to the hydrography dataset in order to provide a means to create shapefiles to represent abundance data associated with them. Streams added were digitized at no more than 1:24,000 scale based on stream line images portrayed in 1:24,000 Digital Raster Graphics (DRG).These features generally represent abundance counts resulting from stream surveys. The linear features in this layer typically represent the location for which abundance data records apply. This would be the reach or length of stream surveyed, or the stream sections for which a given population estimate applies. In some cases the actual stream section surveyed was not specified and linear features represent the entire stream. In many cases there are multiple datasets associated with the same length of stream, and so, linear features overlap. Please view the associated datasets for detail regarding specific features. In CalFish these are accessed through the ""link"" that is visible when performing an identify or query operation. A URL string is provided with each feature in the downloadable data which can also be used to access the underlying datasets.The coho data that is available via the CalFish website is actually linked directly to the StreamNet website where the databases tabular data is currently stored.

A total of 52 transect surveys at 17 study sites were conducted between March and June 2017. For each survey, a single observer walked two 200-meter transects and recorded counts and distances of all wildlife observed. The two transects are laid out as a cross intersecting at a right angle, with this intersection occurring at survey site center. The exact orientation of the cross and the sinuosity of transects was left to the discretion of the surveyor(s) to optimize sampling of the site-designated lifeform and to facilitate ease of travel (e.g., barriers or steep slopes). In the case of a riparian lifeform site, one transect was aligned along or near the stream course, and the second along the gradient extending to either side of the stream course. In the case of a guzzler or wetland, transects were aligned along approximately perpendicular sides. A laser rangefinder was used to accurately measure the perpendicular distance from the transect to the location of each wildlife group at the instance of its initial observation.

Survey results provide insight into a school's learning environment and contribute a measure of diversification that goes beyond test scores on the Progress Report. NYC School Survey results contribute 10% - 15% of a school's Progress Report grade (the exact contribution to the Progress Report is dependent on school type). Survey questions assess the community's opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school's strengths and target areas for improvement. 

The NYC School Survey helps school leaders understand what key members of the school community say about the learning environment at each school. The information captured by the survey is designed to support a dialogue among all members of the school community about how to make the school a better place to learn."

The data was consolidated at the GSTC and used in the Draft Environment Impact Statement. Between the draft and final stages of the Environmental Impact Statement, the data was updated by the forests to reflect any corrections to Inventoried Roadless Areas that were based on existing forest plans and administrative record. The data was also supplemented to include Special Designated Area information and to include Inventoried Roadless Areas within Special Designated Areas. The data was resubmitted to the GSTC on July 21, 2000 for consolidation and the completed coverage was used in the Roadless Area Conservation Final Environmental Impact Statement. IRAs are based on completed forest plans, forest plans in revision where the agency has established an inventory (this information should be available in Appendix C of most forest plans), or other assessments that are completed and adopted by the agency. RARE II (Roadless Area Review and Evaluation of 1977 and 1978) information was used in cases where a forest does not have a more current roadless inventory, which was established using RARE II information. <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.RoadlessArea_2001.xml' target='_blank'>Metadata</a>"

Baseline characterizations were conducted by the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) between August and October of 2010 and 2011. Visual SCUBA surveys took place at sites within MPAs and at their associated reference sites (sites outside MPA) to establish quantitative baselines for measuring future MPA effects (i.e., changes in community structure due to MPA implementation).

From Point Arena to Salt Point, 35 cells (fundamental sampling units) were sampled via fish transects (inside and outside of MPAs) using stratified sampling across shore and at various depths in the kelp forests (5m, 10m, 15m and 20m). Utilizing PISCOs GPS coordinates of the 35 study cells (points), and details from PISCOs methods (see link above), we created estimated footprints of the areas in which these transects were surveyed (the 35 fundamental sampling units). From there, we also estimated the aggregated site polygons (aggregate sampling units) that comprise either an MPA or an MPA reference site; this resulted in 12 new polygons that were representative of the kelp and shallow rock ecosystems surveyed by PISCO. Stewarts Point SMR and SMCA are combined in the survey summaries to make up one of the ‘aggregate sampling units'' and therefore those feature classes have 11 instead of 12 features.These estimated study areas (fundamental and aggregate sampling units) were then used to synthesize and represent PISCOs fish survey results into the following map service product.

California hospitals track and report deep incisional and organ/space SSIs for adults and pediatric patients for 28 types of operative procedures: 
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair; abdominal hysterectomy; appendix surgery; bile duct, liver or pancreatic surgery, cardiac surgery; Cesarean section; colon surgery; coronary artery bypass graft with both chest and donor site incisions; coronary artery bypass graft with chest incision only*; exploratory abdominal surgery (laparotomy); gallbladder surgery; gastric surgery; heart transplant; hip prosthesis; kidney surgery; kidney transplant; knee prosthesis; laminectomy; liver transplant; open reduction of fracture; ovarian surgery; pacemaker surgery; rectal surgery; small bowel surgery; spinal fusion; spleen surgery; thoracic surgery; vaginal hysterectomy 

The SSI data tables include information on the statewide and hospital-specific SSI incidence by operative procedure types, displaying procedure counts, number of infections observed (reported) and predicted. NHSN calculates the number of predicted infections using procedure-specific risk adjustment logistic regression models based on 2015 national baseline data and that accounts for particular patient-level factors and hospital characteristics found to be significant predictors of SSI incidence.

Drought leading to water deficit stress is known to reduce performance of galling insects. The shoot tip-galling fly <em>Parafreutreta regalis</em> has been released for biological control of Cape-ivy (<em>Delairea odorata</em>) in California. Lack of moisture during the dry season causes wilting of Cape-ivy shoots, and subsequent reduced host quantity and quality could influence the fly’s ability to multiply and establish. We imposed water deficit stress on potted Cape-ivy plants, then measured the plant’s and insect’s response to water deficit compared to fully-watered plants. Water deficit stress was imposed during female oviposition (short-term), gall development (long-term), or full insect life cycle (long-term). Plants subjected to long-term water deficit showed declines in shoot growth, leaf area, and total biomass. In choice tests, 72% fewer galls were found on water deficit stressed plants, but there was no difference in the numbers of insects per gall. In no-choice tests, long-term water deficit reduced the number and size of galls by up to 51% and 39%, respectively, and puparia inside the galls were up to 35% smaller. Long-term water deficit also increased the time required for the insect to complete its life cycle (egg to adult) by about 10 days, and up to 80% fewer adults emerged, decreasing the fly’s rate of increase by up to five-fold. Our study shows that <em>P. regalis</em> will oviposit and develop successfully on water deficit-stressed plants, but declines in female preference, insect development and abundance could inhibit fly field establishment and/or population growth under climatic drought conditions.</p>

First, we used data from aerial photographic surveys conducted from 1989-2014 to investigate region-wide trends in the populations of Common Murres and Brandt’s Cormorants. We used 173 observations of Common Murre colony abundance at 14 colonies and 123 observations of Brandt’s Cormorant nest abundance at 10 colonies over the 26-year study period. Additionally, aerial photographic surveys conducted in 2014 were used to document location and abundance of Common Murre, Brandt’s Cormorant, and Double-crested Cormorant across the NCSR.

Second, at a more localized scale, we monitored Common Murre reproduction, foraging effort, and diet in 2014 at Castle Rock National Wildlife Refuge using a robotic, remotely-controlled video recording system. Although this is only one of the seabird colonies in the NCSR, it the largest and served to inform our understanding of the mechanisms of population change across the region. Common Murre are very visible and thus ideal for monitoring fine scale patterns in reproduction and changing diet. We measured date of nest initiation, hatching success, fledging success, overall reproductive success, time allocation, provisioning rate, and diet composition via the video. Information gained from these surveys were combined with comparable data from 2007-2013 at Castle Rock to assess baseline condition and variability of these metrics over an 8-year period.

Third, in 2014-2015 we conducted ground-based surveys of coastally breeding seabirds inside and outside of six MPAs to establish a framework for continued MPA monitoring. For this, we conducted intensive monitoring of six species likely to benefit from MPA establishment: Pigeon Guillemot, Brandt’s Cormorant, Pelagic Cormorant, Double-crested Cormorant, Western Gull, and Black Oystercatcher. We collected data on breeding population size, breeding productivity, foraging rates and rates of human-caused disturbance inside and outside of each MPA. We monitored productivity by following individual nests visible from land and calculated annual breeding productivity as number of fledglings produced per breeding pair. We monitored foraging from land-based observation points, recording all birds foraging within a 1 km radius of an observation point. We calculated foraging rates as number of birds foraging per hour of observation. We recorded all human-caused disturbances observed during any land-based survey and calculated disturbance rates as number of disturbances per hour of observation."

Transects were 30-meters long and 2-meters wide swaths above the rocky reef substrate. Divers counted and sized key species of fish (35 species), counted invertebrates (33 species) and algae (9 species), and estimated the percent cover of substrate types and vertical relief of the seafloor. Over the baseline monitoring of 2014-2015, RCCA conducted 18 surveys at eight monitoring sites in the NCSR. Three of these sites have been surveyed since 2007. The data from these surveys were analyzed at multiple scales to provide baseline characterization of the kelp forest ecosystems at the time of MPA implementation. We characterized the biological community at the RCCA monitoring sites by summarizing the physical and biological characteristics of each of the sites. These summaries will serve as a reference point in the future as long-term monitoring continues."

To accomplish this goal our research team conducted extensive community outreach and engagement in the region and conducted in-person interviewed CPFV operators to gather post MPA baseline socioeconomic data and spatial fishing data for the year 2013. Additional to the interview data gathered, we summarized CPFV logbook data from 1992 to 2014 obtained from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to explore historical economic trends and initial changes in North Coast fisheries. This data package include the CPFV logbook data from 1992-20142 provided by California Department of Fish and Wildlife summarized to the port and region level; select summarized survey data from CPFV operator interviews about their operations in the 2013 calendar year, and samples of the spatial data available on the post MPA (2013) fishing grounds at region-fishery and port-fishery scales."

In 1995, under the request of John Ellison, the original coverage was created by Teale Data Center using address matching of the DFG phonebook dataset. In March of 1996, Isaac Oshima and Paul Veisze used a SPOT Imagery confirmation process applied to those facilities for which Teale could not find an address match. The update occurred using SPOT View imagery sent to the various DFG facilities. The key personnel were requested to 'ink-in' the actual physical location(s) considered to be the HQ for that particular facility. The maps were then sent back and the correct point was represented in the GIS by a point. In 1999, under Paul Veisze, GIS staff were allocated the task of calling each facility within a region and checking whether the information on file was correct. The dataset was subsequently updated. Currently, the data is updated through receiving a database from FASB/Tami Garfio (""telephone and facility List""). Point locations are verified by contacting appropriate CDFW staff or cross referencing with google and yahoo maps, gis roads layer, and imagery.</span></p></div></div></div>"

This dataset includes data collected from a total of 700 on-site inspections of single family buildings. The types of data collected during the inspections covers property characteristics, heating and cooling equipment, water heating equipment, appliances, lighting, clothes washing and drying, miscellaneous energy using equipment, and observable operating behavior.  The objective of the inspections was to enhance the residential baseline study with detailed on-site information and, to the degree possible, verify self-reported data from the phone and web surveys."

The exceptionally high diversity of marine life in this region is largely due to the mixing of several major oceanographic current systems, and the region is characterized by strong gradients in environmental conditions. Rocky shores characterize approximately 26.83% of the SCSR, and in many areas attract a large number of individuals who frequent the intertidal zone for recreation, education, and for collecting flora and fauna for food, fish bait, or decoration. Rocky intertidal ecosystems are one of the most heavily human-­‐impacted ecosystems along the mainland southern California coast (in addition to sandy beaches) due to their ease of access, and has made them particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of human activities resulting from both extraction (harvesting and collecting) as well as physicaldisturbance (trampling, overturning and handling)."

We followed the least-cost corridor techniques described by Beier et al. (2007). This analysis identified the least-cost corridor, or the best potential route for each species, between neighboring landscape blocks. The data needed for a least-cost corridor analysis are a resistance raster and landscape blocks. The resistance raster is the inverse of the species distribution model (SDM) output (i.e., Maxent or BioView habitat models, which rank habitat suitability across the landscape from 0-100 for each species). We identified habitat patches for each focal species within each landscape block, and connected those habitat patches using the least-cost corridor models. The least-cost corridor model does not identify barriers, risk and dispersal. We removed urban areas and areas of unsuitable/non-restorable habitat from the corridors and then inspected the corridor to make sure they were continuous. We examined the amount of predicted suitable habitat in each corridor, and measured the distance between habitat patches within each corridor to make sure it was within the maximum dispersal distance for that focal species. If the corridors did not meet these rules then habitat patches on the border of the corridor were added to meet the selection requirements.

This coarse-scale map was based primarily on the concept of ecological integrity, rather than the needs of particular species. Essential Connectivity Areas are placeholder polygons that can inform land-planning efforts, but that should eventually be replaced by more detailed Linkage Designs, developed at finer resolution based on the needs of particular species and ecological processes. It is important to recognize that even areas outside of Natural Landscape Blocks and Essential Connectivity Areas support important ecological values that should not be ""written off"" as lacking conservation value. Furthermore, because the Essential Habitat Connectivity Map was created at the statewide scale, based on available statewide data layers, and ignored Natural Landscape Blocks smaller than 2,000 acres squared, it has errors of omission that should be addressed at regional and local scales."
